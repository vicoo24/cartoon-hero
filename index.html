      <h2>About Liam Gallagher</h2>
        <p>Liam Gallagher achieved both fame and notoriety as the lead singer of Oasis, the band who defined Britpop in the 1990s. By the early 2000s, Gallagher began stepping out of the shadow of his brother Noel (the songwriter who penned most of Oasis' hits), contributing original tunes to the band starting with the 2003 single "Songbird." The siblings split in 2009, leading Liam to take the remaining members of Oasis to form Beady Eye. Once that group ran its course, Gallagher launched a    solo career in 2017 with As You Were, a number one hit in the U.K. Sophomore LP Why Me? Why Not. also topped the British charts, and he followed with an MTV Unplugged set, released in 2020.</p>
        <p>Gallagher was born in Burnage, Manchester, in 1972 to Irish parents Thomas and Peggy Gallagher. Liam, the youngest of three, had two older brothers, Noel and Paul. Having suffered abuse at the hands of their father, both Liam and Noel went on to have troubled teenage years. Although Liam displayed little interest in music early on, in his late teens he began listening to the Beatles, the Who, the Stone Roses, and the Kinks. It was at this time that his lifelong admiration for John Lennon developed (he later named his son Lennon as a tribute to the late Beatle).</p>
